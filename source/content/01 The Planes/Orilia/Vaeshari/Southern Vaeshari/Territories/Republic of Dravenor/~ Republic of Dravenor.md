## Overview
The Republic of Dravenor is not a kingdom of castles and crowns, but a sprawling, gritty network of formally independent city-states bound by trade. It exists as the vital, and only reliable, mercantile artery connecting the prosperous south of Vaeshari to the wild, unexplored north. Its wealth is built on tariffs, tolls, and the services that cater to the endless flow of travelers on the Meridian Road.

This wealth comes at a brutal cost. Dravenor is a land perpetually under soft siege. To the west, bandits and worse spill from the [[Storm-Fang Mountains]] of [[~ The Borderlands]]. To the east, strange things crawl from the depths of the [[Meridian Sea]]. The locals, hardened and cynical, view the constant stream of wealthy southern merchants and foolhardy northern adventurers with a mix of resentment and weary opportunism, leading to strictly segregated quarters in every city.

Currently, Dravenor is a republic in a fragile equilibrium. The Council of Mayors bickers over the division of trade revenues while scrambling to fund the beleaguered guards and private hunters who keep the monsters at bay. It is a place of immense opportunity and even greater danger, where the next caravan might bring gold or a grisly death.

## Summary
## Geography
Dravenor is a rain-drenched coastal strip, perpetually caught between the fury of the Meridian Sea and the looming wall of the [[Storm-Fang Mountains]]. The entire nation exists on the **windward side** of the mountains, where prevailing eastward winds dump nearly constant moisture. There is no dry refuge within its borders; only varying degrees of saturation and storm exposure. Beyond the Storm-Fang Mountains lies the **rain shadow** of the leeward side, an arid badland called [[~ The Borderlands|~ The Borderlands]]. 
### Climate & Weather
Moisture evaporates from the [[Meridian Sea]] and is driven inland by prevailing winds. As this saturated air hits the impassable slopes of the [[Storm-Fang Mountains]], it has nowhere to go but up. It cools, condenses, and releases its burden as precipitation over all of Dravenor. The climate is one of frequent rain, rolling sea fogs, powerful gales, and sudden, violent squalls. Summers are cool and wet, winters are bitter and storm-wracked with occasional sea-snow. The air is always heavy with moisture, leading to rust, rot, dense forests, and churning mud.

### The Two Roads

- **The Meridian Road (The "Golden Road"):** Runs along the coast of Dravenor. Its dangers are maritime and meteorological: coastal monsters, thick fog, landslides, and large storm waves. Protection requires naval patrols, lighthouse networks, and hunters specializing in aquatic horrors.

- **The Mountain Path (The "Rim Run"):** Runs along the treacherous foothills of the [[Storm-Fang Mountains]]. Its dangers are terrestrial and human: mudslides, rockfalls, ambushes and raids by Borderland bandits descending from their dry homeland. Protection requires knowledge of the unstable terrain, fortifications at high passes, and mercenaries skilled in woodland combat.
## History
The history of Dravenor is a testament to grim pragmatism. It is not a tale of a chosen people conquering a fertile land, but of desperate castaways surviving a hostile one, only to discover their misery was their greatest asset. Its rise was impossible until the world had a reason to brave its storms.
### The "Drowning Years"
The first settlers were the discarded and the doomed: exiles, shipwrecked sailors, refugees and criminals fleeing mainland wars. They found the coast of Dravenor and its foothills to be a beautiful yet deadly trap. The constant rains and waterlogged soil made sustained agriculture difficult, limiting communities to fishing, foraging, and small, sodden garden plots. These isolated stockades, like [[Meridian Cross]] on its windy headland and [[Vance's Hold]] in a defensible cove, were less settlements and more permanent shelters. Leadership fell to those who could organize survival, the first Contract-Binders, establishing a tradition of rule by practical ability, not heredity.

### The Pathfinder's Accord (The Birth of Commerce)
For centuries, Dravenor remained a small, rain-swept backwater. Its change in fortune came from the north. Adventurers from [[~ Verdanthal]], returning south with trophies and tales of untamed riches, discovered that the only passable route that avoided endless leagues of swamp and sheer mountain was this very strip. Simultaneously, merchants from the prosperous [[~ Kingdom of Sunstone]] to the south realized the north held vast, untapped wealth. Suddenly, the miserable stockades of Dravenor found themselves as the indispensable choke point on a burgeoning trade route. The locals, experts in surviving the land's dangers, became invaluable as guides, porters, and protectors. In 234 AC, the elders of the five largest holds met at Meridian Cross. Understanding that infighting would destroy their newfound value, they forged the **Pathfinder's Accord**. This was not a patriotic constitution, but a business contract: it standardized tolls for the Meridian Road, created a shared bounty ledger for major threats, and formed the **Council of Mayors** to settle inter-city disputes. Dravenor's "government" was born as a joint trade commission.

### The Sundering and the Rise of the Borderlands
The Accord's mercantile focus was not for all. A faction from the tougher foothill settlements, led by the warrior **Kaelen the Grim**, saw the treaty as a sell-out. They prized strength and sovereignty over southern gold. Refusing to bend the knee to a council of toll-collectors, they rebelled. After a series of vicious skirmishes (the **Sundering**), Kaelen's followers were driven not out, but _up and over_ the Storm-Fang crests. On the leeward, rain-shadow side, they found a harsh, arid land that matched their temperament, the desolate reaches that would become the [[~ The Borderlands]]. From these dry bastions, their descendants now look upon Dravenor with enduring hatred and envy, their raids a perpetual drain on the republic's resources. The Sundering defined Dravenor's border and its eternal human adversary.

### The Guilded Age and Present Tensions
Fueled by the relentless flow of trade, Dravenor transformed. Stone replaced wood, and specialized **Guilds** (Cartographers, the League of Salvage and Bounty) arose, wielding power rivaling the mayors. The need for specialized monster-hunters formalized the freelance **Greycloaks**, who operate on contracts from cities, guilds, or desperate individuals. Today, Dravenor is wealthy but strained. Its original failing (poor agriculture) has become a permanent vulnerability, making it dependent on imported food and thus eternally invested in the security of trade. The Council is fractured by debates over who truly bears the burdens of defense. The wealth gap between merchant elites and the steadfast locals grows, and the monsters, far from being eradicated, seem to evolve with the rising bounties. Dravenor's history is a cycle: survival forged unity, unity unlocked wealth, wealth breeds internal strife, and strife invites the old dangers back in. The republic persists because the alternative would mean a return to the Drowning Years.
